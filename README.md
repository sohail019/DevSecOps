Aim: Practice Source code management on GitHub. Experiment with the source code written in exercise 1

Description:

To practice source code management on GitHub, you can follow these steps:
Create a GitHub account if you don't already have one.
Create a new repository on GitHub.
Clone the repository to your local machine: $ git clone <repository- url>
Move to the repository directory: $ cd <repository-name>
Create a new file in the repository and add the source code written in exercise 1.
Stage the changes: $ git add <file-name>
Commit the changes: $ git commit -m "Added source code for a simple user registration form"
Push the changes to the remote repository: $ git push origin master
Verify that the changes are reflected in the repository on GitHub. These steps demonstrate how to use GitHub for source code management. You can use the same steps to manage any source code projects on GitHub. Additionally, you can also explore GitHub features such as pull requests, code review, and branch management to enhance your source code management workflow.
